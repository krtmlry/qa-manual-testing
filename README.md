> link to site: https://www.saucedemo.com/

### Overview
Swag labs demo website is created by SauceLabs for aspiring testers to practice manual and automation testing. In this project, we will only cover manual testing of the application.

This document contains user stories, description of functional requirements, acceptance criteria and mockup of the UI design that will serve as a guide for the testers.

### Objective
The objective of this project is to learn how to execute a manual testing procedure, create functional requirement specification, create test cases and how to do bug reporting.

The project will mainly be focused on testing an e-commerce demo website made by saucelabs. 
The demo website has provided different scenarios for each user credentials that are given.
Some of the bugs are visual, and some are functional.

### Limitations
User credential `“locked_out_user”` will not be tested, since it is not able to access the application using this credential.

This project will only focus on the following core functionalities of the application.
1. Log-in and Log-out
2. Adding / Removing items to cart
3. View product details
4. View shopping cart
5. Checkout process
